This is a beta release of a background process for collecting data from 
WMR968 based weather stations. This software will only work on POSIX 
based systems (*nix) 

The application consists of three scripts:
wmr968d.pl - daemon process, reads from serial port and writes to database
wmrsum.pl  - cron script for consolidating raw data to hour/day/month/year
wmr        - init.d or rc.d sh script

The Perl scripts require the following modules
Device::SerialPort
Config::Fast
DBI
Getopt::Mixed

Install:
mysql < wmr.mysqldump
./install

Start:
wmr968d.pl start

Crontab:
5 * * * *       /usr/bin/wmrsum.pl
